Hello! My name is **Kuriakose Mathew** and I am a Master of Science student in Software Engineering at Athlone Institute of Technology.

It was a beautiful day in Ireland and I had nothing to do as well, So I thought, well Kuriakose,you are smart,young guy ;) and you've got many life experiences as well,so why not start a blog and let
the world know who you are.

Well, that was just the beginning and I forked this beautiful theme from hugo and bought a domain from Godaddy.

Wait, this is supposed to be a bio right??

Well, lets get back to me, Before coming to Athlone,I worked for Temenos India Pvt. Ltd,Bangalore for 10 months as a software engineer.I also hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Mahatma Gandhi University,Kottayam.

Yea, what you are thinking is correct,I am from the southern most district of India,God's own country,Kerala.

When I am free I search for wisdom on quora,read some books and maybe stalk the profiles of some beautiful girls on instagram.Now, I add to that list this website.

Jokes apart,through this website I will share my experiences as an international student abroad,some life changing experiences I had and maybe some simple technical articles as well.
I will also try to write upon on the new technological trend- Blockchain.

Feel free to get in touch or drop me a line on social networks mentioned.

Stay tuned for the blogs! Good Day!
